# Creating QR Codes

## Introduction

The main feature of the Blockwell-QR system is the ability to create QR
Codes to perform any transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. Anyone can
then use them on any device with a web browser to interact with the
blockchain.

Creating QR Codes is currently free and unrestricted, you can simply go
to the [QR Creator](https://qr.blockwell.ai/code) on the Blockwell-QR
website and make one.

## Regarding contracts

Blockwell-QR needs some information on the contract itself before QR
Codes can be created. At this time we don't have an automatic process
in place for you to provide that information.

A contract will work in the QR Creator automatically if:

1. The contract is created by a 
  [Blockwell Deployer](../contracts/blockwell-contracts.md#what-are-deployers)
2. OR; the contract is verified on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io).

In other cases, you can contact us at <blockwell@blockwell.ai> and we
can get your contract added to the system. We are working on adding
more automated methods for adding contracts.
