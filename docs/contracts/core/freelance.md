## Introduction

Freelance Core is an extension to [Core](./README.md) that's geared more towards
freelance work with one-off payments. In most aspects it's much like standard
[Core](./README.md), but with some key differences.

### Payments With Other Tokens

When a Task is posted, the reward is set in any ERC-20 compatible payment token.
Whoever completes the Task successfully will receive that as payment in addition
to a small amount of Core for governance.

For example, a Task could be posted with a 400 USDT payment to be received on
successful completion.

When a payment token is used, a protocol fee is assessed in addition to the
reward payment. This fee is currently 10% of the reward. That reward is
distributed among Core token holders.

### Governance Tokens

The Core token in the contract itself used for governance is gained and lost
more slowly. The managers of a given Freelance board can also freely give
and take away the Core tokens for that board.

For example, when Acme creates their own Freelance Core, a governance Core
token is minted at the same time, called Acme Core. Freelancers who are given
Acme Core gain access to Acme's Freelance board. Acme's managers can thus control
access rights for users of their board.

### Aggregated Board

Freelancers who have access to multiple Freelance Cores from different groups
and companies can see all the potential work they have access to in a single
board:
