# Using Blockwell Wallet

The Blockwell Wallet system is built on top of [API Miner](../tools/apiminer), and each
user has their own wallet managed by Blockwell and the [API Miner](../tools/apiminer) 
system. We call this your **Blockwell Wallet**.

When you first [register an account](https://app.blockwell.ai), a new wallet
will be created for you that you can use through the Blockwell Wallet apps. You will
receive an email with your wallet address and some tips for using it.

You can use your wallet on any Ethereum chain that's connected to our system,
and you can use it for anything you want. The wallet is primarily used through
QR Codes, but we are also planning on adding more tools into the app directly
for basic token actions.

## Gas

To make transactions on Ethereum, you have to pay for gas using Ether. You
can [learn more about gas on EthHub](https://docs.ethhub.io/using-ethereum/transactions/#gas).

When we create your Blockwell Wallet, we already send it some Ether on the
Rinkeby Test Network, so you can start trying it out right away.

Once you want to use it on the Main Ethereum Network, you'll need to send a
small amount of Ether to it to pay for gas.

## Sending assets to your Blockwell Wallet

You can send ETH and tokens to your Blockwell Wallet the same way you send 
to any wallet.

How you send ETH and tokens depends on what wallet you're using currently. 
Here are some guides provided by the wallet creators.

## Withdrawing from exchanges

You can also withdraw assets to your Blockwell Wallet directly from an
exchange. Simply put in your Blockwell Wallet address as the withdrawal
address.
