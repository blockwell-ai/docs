# Creating QR Codes

## Introduction

The main feature of the Blockwell Wallet system is the ability to create QR
Codes to perform any transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. Anyone can
then use them on any device with a web browser to interact with the
blockchain.

Creating QR Codes is currently free and unrestricted, you can simply go
to the [QR Creator](https://app.blockwell.ai/code) on the Blockwell Wallet
website and make one.

## Regarding contracts

Blockwell Wallet needs some information on the contract itself before QR
Codes can be created. Most contracts will be added automatically, but
if you run into issues with a contract not being found, contact us
[on Telegram](http://t.me/Blockwell)
and we can get your contract added to the system.
