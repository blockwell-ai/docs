Blockwell Palette is a special interface-builder geared for blockchain data and dapps. It lets you **create dapp
UIs by drag-and-drop** and design and style them **without coding**.

- Read values from the blockchain, whether it's just token balances, or a complex purpose-built smart contract.
- Allow your users to make transactions using [bApps](../wallet/bapps.md).
- Very powerful styling controls.
